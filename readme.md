# CI/CD Dev Tool

This tool is a CI/CD development application that leverages AI to analyze and enhance your code. Built with a React front-end and an ASP.NET Core back-end, it interacts with both GitHub and Gemini AI APIs to provide comprehensive code analysis, suggestions, and fixes. This tool helps developers identify potential issues in their code and proposes solutions, improving the overall quality and robustness of their projects.

## Features

- **GitHub Integration:** Fetch your project repository directly from GitHub.
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** The backend connects to Gemini's AI to analyze the code, summarizing its features and identifying potential issues.
- **Issue Detection:** Identifies edge cases and code quality problems that might not be immediately obvious to developers.
- **Fix Suggestions:** Gemini provides suggestions to fix issues found in the code.
- **Comprehensive Reports:** AI-generated reports summarizing the project's features and suggestions for improvement.
